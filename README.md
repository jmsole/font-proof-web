Font Testing Page
=================

This is a fork of the Font Testing Page, which is a tool primarily intended for type designers to 'Drag and Drop' and quickly test their fonts in a browser.

Notes:

- 100% safe: Your fonts are only stored in your own browser (using `localStorage`) and **nothing gets uploaded to any server**
